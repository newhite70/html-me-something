        <h2>Early Days</h2>
    
        <p class="white">I have enjoyed playing video games for as long as I can remember. <br> 
            I started out playing Mario and Duck hunt like many people. <br>
            My favorites from the early days of games would have to be Mortal Kombat and Sonic. <br>
            My love for games only grew more the older I got and the more advanced game systems became. <br>
            When the N64 came out we got Mario 64 and Diddy Kong Racing. It was the first time that my siblings and I could all sit and play together.</p>
           
                <h3>Mario 64</P>

            <h2>Playstation 2</h2>
           
           <article>
        <p class="white">For Christmas in 2000 my siblings and I got a Playstation 2.  This was a major upgrade from the N64.  This generation of games brought
            the great games like Vice City and FFX.  These games occupied me for most of my cold winters and rainy days.  It wasn't until 2007 when I upgraded again and got a 360 with Halo 3.  
            I had played Halo before, but Halo 3 was a special kind of game.</p>
           
                <h3>Final Fantasy X</P>

        <h2>Currently</h2>
        <article>  
        <p class="white">Today my wife and I both still play games together when we have time.  We have the Switch and a couple Xbox Ones.
            We still enjoy playing the old games on the Switch now that they have brought them back.  I hate to admit it, but she is much better than me at Mario nowdays but there is not contest when we play something else like Smash Bros or Halo.
